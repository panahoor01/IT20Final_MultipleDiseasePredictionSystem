# Multiple Disease Prediction System

This is a Python / Streamlit-based app for predicting multiple diseases (Diabetes, Heart disease, Parkinson’s, etc.) using machine learning models.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Here’s a high-level view of the folders and files:


- Each disease folder contains the code / data / model specific to that disease.
- `saved models/` contains serialized models (e.g. `.pkl` or `.joblib`) used by the app.
- The “Multiple Disease Prediction System” folder is likely where you integrate all disease models into a unified app.
- `streamlit run command.txt` — hints the command to run the Streamlit app.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/panahoor01/IT20Final_MultipleDiseasePredictionSystem.git
   cd IT20Final_MultipleDiseasePredictionSystem
